## ECEN 5813- Principles of Embedded Softwares: Project 3
## Authors: Harsimransingh Bindra, Smitesh Modak
Date: 10/29/2017

Supported Platforms: Freedom Freescale KL25Z, HOST LINUX-Ubuntu.

Implementations:

1. Used DMA to perform data memory movements
2. Enhanced circular buffer code to be more efficient and robust
3. Developed a binary logger to send data to a UART
4. Profiled library functions to determine execution time
5. Created a SPI driver to interface with a Nordic Wireless transceiver
6. Created a Python script to decode your binary log data and print more meaningful messages to the screen
